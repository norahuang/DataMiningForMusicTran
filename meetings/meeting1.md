#### Purpose: Project Design and Tasks

#### Description:

- Action item:
  * Monophonic versus polyphonic :Have a more clear idea about monophonic and polyphonic music and decided which one should be involved in our project
  <br>
    Nora, Aazim and Parul 

  * Acoustic Features: read at least one paper(from the reference folder or find a new one) and get a deep understand of it. Figure out which feature(s) should be used as the input for the following datemining component.
  <br>
    Nora, Aazim and Parul

  * Classifier/Data Mining Algorithms: Read at least one paper(can be the same as the previous one), figure out which classifier or data mining algorithm they are using
  <br>
     Nora, Aazim

  * Dataset: The audio input for training and testing. Try to find out resources as soon as possible. Can basic on the dataset used in the paper you read. It should not be spread all kinds of instruments but focus on one kind of them.
  <br>
      Nora, Aazim and Parul

  * Language, library and Framework: basically we are going to use python as our main coding language. Figure out which libraries are going to be used for each component.(Such as Marsyas for features extraction Scipy etc.)
  <br>
      Erika, Aazim and Nora

  * verification methods and matrix: Perceived versus Quantized. Accuracy and performance. More detail should come up later.
  <br>
     

  * Draft of MIR Design Spec:
  <br>
    Nora will Draft the outline before next meeting for Design Spec. Aazim and Parul will add details basic on the previous action items.
