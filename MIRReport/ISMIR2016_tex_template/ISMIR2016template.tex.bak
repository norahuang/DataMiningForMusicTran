\begin{abstract}
The objective of this project is to evaluate the accuracy of various models to perform automatic music transcription by extracting features from the audio music and applying different classifiers to get the note. Through this initiative we plan to focus at transcription on certain music instruments. Furthermore, only the main instrument of the polyphonic music will be transcribed.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
The dataset for this project will collected through MIDI Aligned Piano Sounds (MAPS) , Isophonics Annotations , KSN Database to name a few. The sources claim the data is used for transcriptions of both monophonic \& polyphonic instruments. The datasets are annotated \& we would evaluate the data to use music relevant for this project.  \\\\
Then acoustics features such as Zero Crossing Rate, Autocorrelation, YIN metrics for time domain \& FFT , STFT , Spectrogram , cestrum metrics, spectral flux for the frequency domain would be used to extract notes from audio music. \\\\
The extracted features will be used as input to the classifiers for note transcription. Different classifiers, such as K-NN, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector Machines (SVM) would be evaluated for accuracy. Features would be combined together to give better accuracy on real world data.\\
\\
Marsyas would be used as the framework for acoustic features extraction. Python \& Scikit-learn would be used to prepare the learning model, which would eventually, transcribe.

\section{Dataset}\label{sec:Dataset}
We obtained data for both monophonic and polyphonic sounds through MAPS. We're also in the process of having data from Isophonics Annotations \& KSN Database. 

\section{Acoustic features for training}\label{sec:features}
Time Domain : Zero Crossing Rate, Autocorrelation, YIN metrics Frequency Domain : FFT , STFT , Spectrogram , cestrum metrics, spectral flux.

\section{Classifiers}\label{sec:Classifiers}
Stochastic Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines


\section{Result}\label{sec:Result}
This would comprise of the collection of features, classifiers used to give the highest level accuracy. Various combinations would be tried, but only the one's that generalize well, would be mentioned in the result. 

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:Conclusion}
Basic on the result we should be able to figure out which combination is best for automatic music transcription.
