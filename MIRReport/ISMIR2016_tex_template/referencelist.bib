	abstract = {Given a musical audio recording, the goal of music transcription is to determine a score-like representation of the piece underlying the recording. Most current transcription methods employ variants of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which often fails to robustly model instruments producing non-stationary sounds. Using entire time-frequency patterns to represent sounds, non-negative matrix deconvolution (NMD) can capture certain types of non-stationary behavior but is only applicable if all sounds have the same length. In this paper, we present a novel method that combines the non-stationarity modeling capabilities available with NMD with the variable note lengths possible with NMF. Identifying frames in NMD patterns with states in a dynamical system, our method iteratively generates sound-object candidates separately for each pitch, which are then combined in a global optimization. We demonstrate the transcription capabilities of our method using piano pieces assuming the availability of single note recordings as training data.},

	abstract = {In this work, a probabilistic model for multiple-instrument automatic music transcription is proposed. The model extends the shift-invariant probabilistic latent component analysis method, which is used for spectrogram factorization. Proposed extensions support the use of multiple spectral templates per pitch and per instrument source, as well as a time-varying pitch contribution for each source. Thus, this method can effectively be used for multiple-instrument automatic transcription. In addition, the shift-invariant aspect of the method can be exploited for detecting tuning changes and frequency modulations, as well as for visualizing pitch content. For note tracking and smoothing, pitch-wise hidden Markov models are used. For training, pitch templates from eight orchestral instruments were extracted, covering their complete note range. The transcription system was tested on multiple-instrument polyphonic recordings from the RWC database, a Disklavier data set, and the MIREX 2007 multi-F0 data set. Results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms leading approaches from the transcription literature, using several error metrics.},

	abstract = {Automatic music transcription is considered by many to be a key enabling technology in music signal processing. However, the performance of transcription systems is still significantly below that of a human expert, and accuracies reported in recent years seem to have reached a limit, although the field is still very active. In this paper we analyse limitations of current methods and identify promising directions for future research. Current transcription methods use general purpose models which are unable to capture the rich diversity found in music signals. One way to overcome the limited performance of transcription systems is to tailor algorithms to specific use-cases. Semi-automatic approaches are another way of achieving a more reliable transcription. Also, the wealth of musical scores and corresponding audio data now available are a rich potential source of training data, via forced alignment of audio to scores, but large scale utilisation of such data has yet to be attempted. Other promising approaches include the integration of information from multiple algorithms and different musical aspects.},

However, current transcription approaches either focus on detecting pitched sounds (from pitched musical instruments) or on detecting unpitched sounds (from drum kits). In this paper, we propose a method that jointly transcribes pitched and unpitched sounds from polyphonic music recordings. The proposed model extends the probabilistic latent component analysis algorithm and supports the detection of pitched sounds from multiple instruments as well as the detection of un-pitched sounds from drum kit components, including bass drums, snare drums, cymbals, hi-hats, and toms. Our experiments based on polyphonic Western music containing both pitched and unpitched instruments led to very encouraging results in multi-pitch detection and drum transcription tasks.},

We evaluate the influence of three TFR functions including IIR, FIR filter bank semigram (FBSG) and constant-Q transform semigram in automatic music transcription task, on a database of popular and polyphonic classic music. The experiment results show that the filter bank based representations are suitable for multiple-instrument recordings and a CQT-based representation turns out to provide very accurate transcription for solo-instrument recordings.},

	abstract = {Pitch, together with other midlevel music features such as rhythm and timbre, holds the promise of bridging the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantics for music understanding. This paper investigates the pitch estimation of a piano music signal by exemplar-based sparse representation. A note exemplar is a segment of a piano note, stored in the dictionary. We first describe how to represent a segment of the piano music signal as a linear combination of a small number of note exemplars from a large note exemplar dictionary and then show how the sparse representation problem can be solved by -regularized minimization. The proposed approach incorporates tuning factor estimation, note candidate selection, and hidden-Markov-model-based smoothing into the estimation process to improve accuracy. Unlike previous approaches, the proposed approach does not require retraining for a new piano. Instead, only a dozen notes of the new piano are needed. This feature is computationally attractive and avoids intense manual labeling. The system performance is evaluated using 70 classical music recordings of two real pianos under different recording conditions. The results show that the proposed system outperforms four state-of-the-art systems.},

The amplitudes of the active pitches are also recursively updated, allowing for a smooth and more accurate representation. When evaluated on a set of ten music pieces, the proposed method is shown to outperform other general purpose multipitch estimators in either accuracy or computational speed, although not being able to yield performance as good as the state-of-the art methods, which are being optimally tuned and specifically trained on the present instruments. However, the method is able to outperform such a technique when used without optimal tuning, or when applied to instruments not included in the training data.},

Two different instance-based pitch classification methods are proposed, the choice of which depends on the size of the available training database. In the first method, the conventional K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is trained on a large database of piano tones and employed for monophonic pitch detection. For cases where the training database contains only one sample from each possible note, a two-step algorithm, combining semi-KNN pitch candidate selection and note sequence tracking, is suggested. It is demonstrated that in the abundance of training data, the KNN algorithm along with a proper choice of the distance measure and K, yields high performance accuracy. Furthermore, the two-step algorithm is capable of compensating for the shortage of data by incorporating prior musicological information in the transcription process.},
